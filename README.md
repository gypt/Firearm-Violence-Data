# United States Firearm Violence - Data Science (Python)
This project is based on a dataset that records instances of firearm violence in the United States from 2014-2022. 
My goals for this project were to categorize and rank all cities (with more than 500 incidents) and states in order of safety. 
I chose to visualize the number of incidents per year from 2014-2021, and the average number of incidents per month. 

Note: The csv dataset was too large at 33MB and is compressed within data.zip
